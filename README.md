## Howdy, Stranger!

Ask a Parent was born out of the desire to create fellowship, helpful, and downright entertaining community solutions. Ask a Parent is intended to be  used as a discussion forum and long form chat room. I couldn't be happier you've decided to use Ask a Parent to grow your community.
